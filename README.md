# Computational-physics

The aim of this project is to, using a random number generator, imitate a path taken by a neutron travelling through slabs of water, lead, and graphite. This simulation of a random walk can then be used to obtain probabilities related to the three different outcomes of a neutron scattering through these media. Those are: reflection, absorption, and transmission.

In this project I will:

- Discuss different methods of generating random numbers,
- Investigate how nenutrons penetrate different types of metrials,
- Find the attenuation depth of different media,
- For each investigated material I will determine the macroscopic absorption and scattering cross-sections and the resultant mean free path,
- Inspect how probability of transmission is affected when I change the thickness of the media.
